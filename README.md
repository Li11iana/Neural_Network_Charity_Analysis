# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Implementation of Tensor Flow Neural Networks and deep learning for data analysis

## Overview

A nonprofit foundation aims to better predict when to invest by analyzing the data from 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soups.
Neural networks is an optimal tool when regular machine learning classifier model fall short. 

### Objective

Generate a binary classifier capable of predicting if an applicant will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

* Models target selection

* Model's Variable selection 

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
